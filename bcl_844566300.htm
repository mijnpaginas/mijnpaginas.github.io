<P class="p0 ft0">CERSEI</P>
<P class="p1 ft2">Cersei Lannister stood tall and proud next to her father in the great pavilion that had been laid before Bronzegate. Both and she and Lord Tywin were clad in the crimson and gold of their house, wearing the most opulent clothing they possessed. She took a deep breath, to calm her fluttering stomach. <SPAN class="ft1">You are a lion, and the lion does not show fear before lesser beasts</SPAN>, she reminded herself, glancing at her father. Tywin Lannister stood still like a magnificent statue, the banner of House Lannister spread over him. If he felt any discomfort standing here, he didn't show it. Cersei turned her eyes back to the banners of Stannis and his supporters, and tried to name them. Some were easy to recognize, like the stag of Baratheon, or the dire wolf of Stark, others took some effort, like the <NOBR>lizard-lion</NOBR> of House Reed, or the lightning bolt of Dondarrion but many were strange to her. <SPAN class="ft1">I will have to learn them all</SPAN>, she thought, as she puzzled over a very odd <NOBR>one-a</NOBR> black ship with what appeared to be an onion on its sails. It would look very ill for a queen not to know her subjects banners...</P>
<P class="p2 ft2">She wished Jaime were here. She had not seen him for months now. Cersei had hoped to join him at King's Landing, for a brief reunion, but father had insisted she rush to him on the road to Bronzegate. Her heart bled for her <NOBR>brother-all</NOBR> alone in King's Landing, with no friends around him, surrounded by a thousand accusing eyes. <SPAN class="ft1">I wish I were there right now, to put my arms around him, and tell him that everything is all right, that he will always have me</SPAN>...</P>
<P class="p3 ft2">But that would be a <NOBR>lie-a</NOBR> sweet lie, but a lie nonetheless. Her father was wedding her to Stannis Baratheon, to save her house, and her brother. "He is a young man with ideas," Tywin Lannister had said to her, as they rode to Bronzegate, "but a young man nonetheless. And the favor of young men is easily won by beauty and the minds of young men easily distracted from grand ideas. Bewitch him. Win his affection, and make him more... agreeable." His eyes had fixed on hers as he said this. "You can do this, my dear?"</P>
<P class="p4 ft1"><SPAN class="ft2">Cersei gulped. </SPAN>It is for Jaime's sake. Jaime killed the old king, that awful old man, and now... now they are calling for his head. I must wed Stannis to save his life<SPAN class="ft2">. She felt a chill and wished her </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft2">soon-to-be-</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft2"> betrothed would hurry up and show himself. It was uncomfortable standing here in this miserable weather.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p5 ft2">As if in response to her wish, a crowd made its way from that small sea of banners. A large man with an antlered helmet stood at its head, clad in black and gold. That had to be Stannis. As he got closer, Cersei got her first look at her <NOBR>husband-to-be.</NOBR> Stannis was tall, and looked strong, but his face was thin and jagged and pinched looking, with a large jaw and hollow cheeks. Cersei suppressed a <NOBR>frown-not</NOBR> an ugly man, exactly, but not a handsome one either. <SPAN class="ft1">It is for Jaime's </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft1">sake-Jaime</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft1"> and the Lannisters. </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft1">I-I</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft1"> will be queen. </SPAN>Somehow, she couldn't make herself believe the last part.</P>
<P class="p6 ft2">Tywin took her hand, and then swiftly knelt before Stannis. Cersei followed her father's example, doing her best to follow her father's advice. <SPAN class="ft1">Smile at him. Look at him softly and tenderly, all full of sweetness. </SPAN>"Your Grace," declared Tywin grandly, his face a hard mask that gave away nothing, "I come here to pledge my leal fealty. With me is my daughter, who has fallen in love with you from afar from the mere hearing of your great valor and nobility, and for whom I humbly ask the honor of being granted your hand in marriage."</P>
<P class="p7 ft2">To her surprise, Stannis did not look at her, and instead kept his eyes fixed on her father. "Why do you kneel, Lord Lannister? You are Lord Paramount of the Westerlands, and I am Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. We meet here as equals." Stannis' voice was hard and rough. <SPAN class="ft1">He sounds like an old man</SPAN>, thought Cersei, who couldn't help but remember Prince Rhaegar's lovely voice singing, or even the fair sound of her sweet Jaime's laughter.</P>
<P class="p8 ft2">"Can the Seven Kingdoms go without a king?" asked Tywin, his voice ringing in the pavilion. "I say they cannot. And that being the case... what other king can there be but you?"</P>
<P class="p9 ft2">Stannis frowned at that. "There are Targaryens yet alive," he noted. "What of them? I cannot claim the Iron Throne by mere whim. To do so would be mad folly."</P>
<P class="p10 ft2">"Your Grace's natural humility and care for the laws do you great credit," said another voice. Cersei looked to the side to see Grand Maester Pycelle tottering his way from her father's retinue. "But I must say they</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_2">


<P class="p11 ft2">are unwarranted in this case. You, Stannis Baratheon, are the lawful and most apparent King of these Seven Kingdoms, by simple and <NOBR>well-practiced</NOBR> precedent." Cersei blinked. She had wondered why the Grand Maester had come with them from King's Landing. Somehow, finding out why was proving...</P>
<P class="p12 ft2">disquieting. As Pycelle tottered to the center of the great green, Cersei felt her leg twitch in discomfort. <SPAN class="ft1">Not now, </SPAN>she thought, doing her best to keep her movements subtle and a smile on her face.</P>
<P class="p13 ft2">The Grand Maester cleared his throat, and unrolled a large scroll. "Now then, Your Grace, your accession is based on the same sound principles as that of your <NOBR>great-grandfather,</NOBR> Aegon V. When your most honored ancestor took the throne, it was based on the decision of the Grand Council of the Realm. Aegon was the youngest of his father's four sons, though the two eldest had predeceased him. His third brother had taken the vows of my order, which were felt to be enough to remove him from the succession. However, both Prince <NOBR>Daeron-his</NOBR> eldest <NOBR>brother-and</NOBR> Prince <NOBR>Aerion-his</NOBR> second <NOBR>eldest-had</NOBR> left issue."</P>
<P class="p14 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Shut up, old man</SPAN>, thought Cersei, hoping against hope that Pycelle would stop talking soon. She did not see how any of this concerned what was happening now. <SPAN class="ft1">Aerion... Prince Aerion... where have I heard that name? </SPAN>She tried to remember, but could not. The twitch in her leg was becoming an irritating ache, and her knees were starting to throb. She looked at her father, but aside from a slight downward twitch of his mouth, he seemed utterly unmoved. Stannis likewise stood stiff as a statue, frowning, though Cersei saw much of his retinue twitching, and at least one yawning. <SPAN class="ft1">Lucky man...</SPAN></P>
<P class="p15 ft2">"Now," continued Pycelle, manifestly warming to his subject, "Daeron's child was a daughter and thus, by <NOBR>long-established</NOBR> precedent, behind Aegon by the normal principles of succession. However, Aerion had left a son, Maegor." Cersei blinked. That seemed odd to her somehow... and then the name Aerion leapt to the forefront of his mind. <SPAN class="ft1">The Prince Who Thought He Was A Dragon, the one who died drinking wildfire</SPAN>... "Despite young Maegor's excellent claim," continued Pycelle, "the combination of his own extreme youth, and his late father's known instability lead the Council to exclude him from the succession." The Maester nodded at Stannis. "Your Grace, this renders the situation as clear as the sun in the sky on a bright and cloudless day. With the deaths of Prince Rhaegar and your most worthy brother Robert, you are the oldest and closest male heir in the line of descent not bound by oath from the throne. Aerys' surviving <NOBR>children-like</NOBR> Prince <NOBR>Maegor-are</NOBR> both far too young to assume a true and proper rule, and, again like Prince Maegor, bear the stain of a father with a mind to unruly for the Iron Throne as, alas, these Seven Kingdoms have discovered to their sorrow."</P>
<P class="p16 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Finally</SPAN>. Cersei prepared to rise only to feel her father's grip tighten on her arm. "And yet, Grand Maester," said Stannis, "I was unaware that there had been a Grand Council on this matter."</P>
<P class="p17 ft2">"Your Grace," said Pycelle with a merry laugh, "what is this present war but a Grand Council by the sword?" He turned around regarding the various lords assembled. "Aerys by breaking the oaths of his own coronation, forced action on the Lords Paramount. Had the ways of peace been open, I am certain they would have <NOBR>taken-but</NOBR> Aerys closed them off as well, and thus created this present tumult which stands for a Grand Council just as a trial by combat stands for a trial by other means." He turned once again to Stannis and smiled a pleasant and grandfatherly smile. "And so, Your Grace, fear not to accept those honors and titles that are your lawful due. You, and no other, are our king."</P>
<P class="p18 ft2">Stannis nodded at this, though it seemed to Cersei his frown had not lightened in the least, and in fact had grown quite severe at several points in Pycelle's recitation. "Very well. This being so, I, Stannis Baratheon, do formally proclaim myself King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, Ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, in the name of the old gods and the new."</P>
<P class="p19 ft2">"Long may you reign," came a solitary voice from his followers. And then, slowly, gradually, applause began and then cheers. Stannis' glanced at the noisy crowd with an undeniable sense of unease, raising his hand. He said something that Cersei couldn't make out over the noise, and then an "Enough" that she could. It seemed to Cersei the plaudits quieted far faster than they'd risen. Stannis turned to Tywin. "Rise, Lord Tywin, and know I accept your fealty, and your daughter's hand in equal measure."</P>
<P class="p20 ft2">"I thank Your Grace for this immeasurable honor," stated Tywin. Cersei took to her feet with great relief. Still, even if it was good to finally get the ache out, all that had been disquieting. Stannis' words were courtly, but his voice was tight and clipped, and the man himself... <SPAN class="ft1">He is no Rhaegar</SPAN>, she thought. <SPAN class="ft1">He is not even a Robert</SPAN>.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_3">


<P class="p21 ft2">Stannis gave a formal, and exceedingly stiff bow. "Lord Buckler offers us the use of Bronzegate for the ceremony and the feast. Shall we enter together, Lord Tywin?"</P>
<P class="p22 ft2">"Once again, Your Grace honors me," said her father flatly. For a moment, Cersei felt a strange wish to run from all this, run far away, but her father's hand remained on her arm, and she was pulled quietly and firmly to the castle.</P>
<P class="p23 ft0">EDDARD</P>
<P class="p24 ft2">Ned sat in the hall of Bronzegate as Lord Buckler's musicians played for the wedding feast. <SPAN class="ft1">The Rains of Castamere</SPAN>, he thought as he recognized the tune. <SPAN class="ft1">A bit grim for a wedding feast, but then this is rather grim for a wedding... </SPAN><NOBR>Stannis-<SPAN class="ft1">King</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft1"> </SPAN><NOBR>Stannis-sat</NOBR> at the head of the table, his eyes fixed on the company. He barely touched the food set before him, and if his wineglass had ever been refilled during the course of the meal, Eddard hadn't seen it. The appetite of Stannis' young queen seemed just as slight, though Ned was willing to put that down to nerves. <SPAN class="ft1">My lady wife ate just as little at our wedding, after all.</SPAN>.. He recalled that he had not seen Catelyn for many months. <SPAN class="ft1">She has given me a son</SPAN>, he thought, <SPAN class="ft1">and I barely know her</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p25 ft2">As 'The Rains of Castamere' ended and 'The Bear and the Maiden Fair' began, William Dustin grabbed a large turkey leg off of Theo Wull's plate. "Hey!" snapped Theo.</P>
<P class="p9 ft2">"I claim this by right of my hunger," said William with a smile. "My hand has acted in place of a Grand Council."</P>
<P class="p26 ft2">Ethan Glover and Martyn Cassel both snickered at that, and even Wull burst into a smile. "Like I'd want anything you got your grubby mitts on," Theo muttered.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2">"That's not what sweet young Jeyne tells me," laughed William.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2">"Fuck you," muttered Theo.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2">"Indeed she has," said William, taking a great bite of his turkey leg.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2">As Mark Rysell shook his head, Ethan Glover looked at the King and Queen. "Suppose there'll be a bedding?"</P>
<P class="p30 ft2">"Hmm, I hope so," said William, leering at Cersei. "I've a wager with young Lord Lolliston on whether the Queen's tits are as fine as the Lady of Winterfell's."</P>
<P class="p27 ft2">Martyn glanced at his friend. "Who'd you wager on?"</P>
<P class="p31 ft2">"That you could ask that of me!" declared William, in mock offense. He placed a hand on Ned's shoulder. "Such is my friendship with you, sweet Ned, that I have wagered a silver stag on your wife's breasts being finer than our new Queen's." William leaned back and stroked his chin. "Which does suggest a rather surprising lack of loyalty on young Meryn's part. Hoster Tully would do well to keep his eye on that one..."</P>
<P class="p32 ft2">Theo Wull gave a snort. "I think your wager will remain a thing of air and words, Dustin. Oh, the Queen's a pretty morsel, I'll grant you, but can you see any maid here wishing to get the clothes off of that." He nodded at Stannis, then shook his head. "Their little hands'll freeze, like as not."</P>
<P class="p33 ft2">Ned frowned as his friends shared a chuckle, feeling a well of pity for the young King and Queen. <SPAN class="ft1">Look at him. He sits there in Robert's place, and he knows it. And </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft1">her-married</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft1"> to a man she doesn't know, who doesn't know her, all for the sake of her father's ambitions</SPAN>... His eyes darted to Tywin, sitting at his own table surrounded by his lords and bannermen. Grand Maester Pycelle sat next to him, oddly enough, sipping a small glass of wine. The pair seemed to be talking and yet through it all, the Lord of Casterly Rock's eyes remained fixed on his daughter and his new goodson. <SPAN class="ft1">Is that the face of a man who's gotten his life's great design, or a man who's been forced to sup on dust and ashes? I cannot tell...</SPAN></P>
<P class="p34 ft2">"Ned," came the familiar voice of Howland Reed.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_4">


<P class="p35 ft2">Eddard turned to see the little cranogman standing at his shoulder. "How... goes matters, Howland?" he asked quietly.</P>
<P class="p36 ft2">Howland glanced around the hall. "I have been asking... and listening," he whispered. "Men often overlook a small man near them, when they talk. And I have heard nothing of the Lady Lyanna."</P>
<P class="p37 ft2">Eddard winced. He'd hoped some rumor of his sister would have at least surfaced, but still nothing. Perhaps he was being <NOBR>naïve-after</NOBR> all, Gregor Clegane, a man who he would have sworn could hide nowhere, remained unfound after all these long weeks. One highborn lady could doubtless do just as <NOBR>well-perhaps</NOBR> even better. <SPAN class="ft1">Assuming she still lives</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2">"Well... keep looking, and listening..." muttered Ned. "I'm certain..."</P>
<P class="p38 ft2">"Ned..." Howland paused, as if considering the best way to put this. "I am not finished. I have heard nothing of the Lady Lyanna... but the Maester... the maester had a raven from Highgarden. Ser Oswell Whent and Arthur Dayne have appeared there, with the White Bull." He took a deep breath. "They came there to bend the knee to Prince Viserys."</P>
<P class="p39 ft0">THE SHE WOLF</P>
<P class="p40 ft2">Lyanna watched on the ship's deck as the great tower of Oldtown faded into the distance. She raised up little Rhaegar. <SPAN class="ft1">There it goes, little one. There it goes for who knows how long. Home. </SPAN>If her son cared that he was leaving the Seven Kingdoms, possibly forever, he did not show it, instead gurgling merrily.</P>
<P class="p41 ft1">He does not know. He's a <NOBR>babe-this</NOBR> is all one to him. He has no understanding to make him <NOBR>sorrow-no</NOBR> memories to make him weep<SPAN class="ft2">. She envied him that. For her, she could not stop remembering. When the Lord Commander told her what the Kingsguard had decided she had wept and pleaded. "Let me go home, </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft2">sers-or</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft2"> if not that, let me find some nice spot of land where me and my son can live in quiet and peace. I care not for titles and honors. Let his little uncle Viserys have all of that. Indeed, who cares what you call him. If not 'Targaryen', let his name be 'Snow', or 'Waters' or even </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft2">'Sand'-he</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft2"> will be my dear son all the same, the memory of his beloved father, and I shall raise him to honor that memory in loyalty, not treachery."</SPAN></P>
<P class="p42 ft2">Ser Arthur Dayne had looked at her with sympathetic eyes at that, and even Oswell Whent had seemed abashed, but Lord Commander Hightower had regarded her sternly. "Lady, you speak many names but the one that all will say, and that one is 'Blackfyre'." And with that he had sent her on her way.</P>
<P class="p43 ft2">She shook her head as she held little Rhaegar to her. She should not let the White Bull turn into an ogre in her <NOBR>mind-he</NOBR> and his sworn brothers had given her <NOBR>funds-Arthur</NOBR> Dayne had even gotten her passage on this ship before going to join the others at Highgarden, and given her a small token, of a dragon rampant, embossed in gold. "There is a house in Braavos, kept by the Crown for state visits. Show this to the people <NOBR>there-they</NOBR> will take care of the rest." That was a kindness.</P>
<P class="p4 ft2">Indeed, all this was a kindness. There would be no place for her among the loyalists, not with a son who muddied the succession and offended Dorne. She'd heard that Prince Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper was coming to the Reach with <NOBR>troops-that</NOBR> was a man, a dangerous man, who would have no love for her or her little son. Of the <NOBR>rebels-well,</NOBR> her brother would receive her kindly, she knew that, but Lord Tywin Lannister had wed his daughter to Stannis Baratheon and... <SPAN class="ft1">A king slain, and a prince and princess all but babes, and poor Elia Martell... </SPAN>Lyanna bit her lip. <SPAN class="ft1">The Lannisters truly are as ravening as lions</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p44 ft2">She looked at her son, and wept. If only they had known! Then she and Rhaegar would have done their duties, gone their separate ways, lived their lives. But they'd been swept up in a sweet madness of love and prophecy and grand futures, but <NOBR>love-love</NOBR> most of all. She thought back to the Tower of Joy. <SPAN class="ft1">We thought we could make a world for us, just we two. </SPAN>Well, they had in the end for a short time, but the price of that world was cruel and bloody. <SPAN class="ft1">Father... Brandon... poor Robert... the king... Elia... the prince and princess... a hundred hundred fine brave men whose names I used to honor... a thousand thousand fine men whose names I will never know... and Rhaegar... Rhaegar... Rhaegar... Rhaegar with his sad eyes and his handsome face, Rhaegar dead on the Trident, Rhaegar dead and gone forever</SPAN>...</P>
<P class="p45 ft2">"Is all all right, miss?"</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_5">


<P class="p0 ft2">Lyanna turned to see a tall Summer Islander standing near her. "No... no...," she sniffled. "I... it is the war. I...</P>
<P class="p0 ft2">much of my family died in it."</P>
<P class="p31 ft2">The man shook his head in sympathy. "That is war, in your lands" he said softly. "Bloody and terrible. It makes children orphans and women widows, and after words the folk of renown they meet and sit together, and sing their songs and suddenly all that has become grand. We in the Summer Islands... we used to be the same, until we saw that when we bled each other, only the slavers profited..." He smiled at her son. "Is that pretty babe yours, miss?"</P>
<P class="p46 ft2">Lyanna nodded quietly. "His father... my husband is dead." She shut her eyes. "Killed in battle." She paused, considering what to say. "He was... a harper."</P>
<P class="p47 ft0">DAVOS</P>
<P class="p48 ft2">"Oh, six maids there were in a <NOBR>spring-fed</NOBR> pool..." sang Ser Peter Plumm drunkenly, as his fellow Lannister men tapped the tune out on the tables. Plumm began to merrily, and unsteadily, dance along with the tune.</P>
<P class="p36 ft1">Look at them. You'd think they were nothing more than a bunch of drunken sailors, if not for their finery. And even then... some of the sailors I know dress just as well... <SPAN class="ft2">Ser Davos Seaworth turned away, feeling acutely embarrassed. Somehow, it felt wrong for him to be here among so many old houses, a member of their revels. </SPAN>All I did was deliver some onions<SPAN class="ft2">... The ends of the fingers of his left hand throbbed, still sore from where the King had chopped them. At moments like this, he wondered if he had made the proper </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft2">choice-and</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft2"> not because of his fingertips.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p49 ft1"><SPAN class="ft2">He shook his head. </SPAN>My sons will stand higher than I ever will. And if I must feel like a pauper among princes to let <NOBR>them-it</NOBR> is worth it<SPAN class="ft2">. Davos felt a sudden tugging at his sleeve. Stannis' </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft2">newly-made</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft2"> squire, young Balon Swann stood at his side. "His Grace wishes to see you," said the young man quietly.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p50 ft4">Davos nodded awkwardly, and rose from his seat, following Balon towards the king. They passed briefly by Lord Tywin who was talking to Grand Maester <NOBR>Pycelle-or</NOBR> rather, listening to the Grand Maester talk. <NOBR>"-worry</NOBR> overmuch," stated Pycelle, sagely stroking his grey beard. "Highgarden is grasping at straws. <NOBR>Why-I</NOBR> myself am being threatened with a Grand Conclave..." It seemed to Davos that Pycelle was talking a bit loud, and he wondered if the Grand Maester was more in his cups than he appeared. The Lord Tywin seemed to glance at Ser Davos as he passed, and despite himself the <NOBR>ex-smuggler</NOBR> felt a chill. <SPAN class="ft3">There's another man who'd rather I was not here</SPAN>... It struck Davos that it seemed strange, and slightly ominous that the Lord of Casterly Rock was seated so far from the king. <SPAN class="ft3">Then again, I don't know if I'd want him too near me if he was my goodfather</SPAN>. His hand went to his luck despite himself.</P>
<P class="p51 ft2">Stannis looked drawn and tired when Davos reached him, and perhaps his eyes mistook him, but Queen Cersei didn't look much better. "Ser Davos," said the King, with something that looked not unlike a smile.</P>
<P class="p27 ft2">Davos managed a rather stiff bow. "Your Grace wished to see me?"</P>
<P class="p52 ft2">"For two reasons," said Stannis. "Firstly, to introduce you to my wife." Cersei Lannister regarded the man, her eyes clouding with puzzlement and what Davos couldn't help but suspect was distaste. "This is Ser Davos Seaworth of Cape Wrath. He saved my life, and the lives of many other fine men."</P>
<P class="p47 ft2">Davos shifted uncomfortably. "I brought some onions, Your Grace. Nothing more."</P>
<P class="p28 ft2">"Through Paxter Redwyne's fleet," stated Stannis. "It was bravely done."</P>
<P class="p28 ft2">The Queen looked at him with growing comprehension. "The knight of the black ship..." she stated.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2">Davos glanced away. "For most, Your Grace, I'm the knight of the onion..."</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">"It is the black ship that I have need of, Davos," said Stannis. "I offered Redwyne a peaceful settlement, if he would bend the knee and put his ships in my service." That faint smile had vanished and become a darker frown than usual. "He has done... quite the opposite."</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_6">


<P class="p54 ft2">"I've... heard something of that manner," muttered Davos. Lord Redwyne's taking the remaining Targaryens to Highgarden had been the talk of Stannis' retinue all the way to <NOBR>Bronzegate-news</NOBR> had even trickled down to him.</P>
<P class="p55 ft2">"I need a fleet," said the King. "A fleet and the men to sail it. Honest men, if they can be found. It occurred to me you might know such men."</P>
<P class="p27 ft2">Davos bit his lip. "The men I know, Your Grace, are <NOBR>honest-up</NOBR> to a point. A point and no further."</P>
<P class="p56 ft2">Stannis nodded. "I suspected as much. And such men will have to <NOBR>serve-for</NOBR> now. Wedding feast or no, Ser <NOBR>Davos-I</NOBR> am fighting a war. And I mean to win it."</P>
<P class="p47 ft0">CERSEI</P>
<P class="p57 ft2">The wine they'd served her was thin and watery, and the food poor and tasteless. <SPAN class="ft1">Such poor hospitality to their King and Queen</SPAN>, thought Cersei. <SPAN class="ft1">If House Buckler imagines they'll gain my favor with this farce, they're fools</SPAN>. She'd barely touched both and now her stomach felt unsettled. Also, the room was dimly lit by flickering, smoky torches, so her eyes were tight and strained. <SPAN class="ft1">As miserable as the rest of this sorry thing</SPAN>, she thought as she rubbed them.</P>
<P class="p58 ft2">She had always thought her wedding would be something grand, that she and the Prince would be wed in Baleor's Great Sept by the High Septon himself in all his finery, surrounded by an admiring throng. Instead the wedding had been held in the sept of a minor castle, presided over a little old man clad in a simple wool robe, with only a bunch of drunken louts to see it. She felt robbed, and not of a possession, but of something she had always felt she carried deep within her, something no one could take away. Oh, there had been moments of magic, such as how just before the ceremony her father had cloaked her in the colors of House Lannister and whispered "Your mother wore this on our wedding," but they had been short and invariably followed by disappointment. <SPAN class="ft1">I wore that cloak for a little while, and then the King took it off and put me in that worn old thing of black and gold</SPAN>... She shut her eyes, and tried to remember what her mother's cloak had felt like, but what would keep coming back to her mind was her mother hugging her in the gardens of Casterly Rock. <SPAN class="ft1">But that was all a long, long time ago</SPAN>...</P>
<P class="p59 ft2">"My lady," came the voice of the king. Her husband. Cersei opened her eyes and saw that he had risen from his seat and was offering her his hand. "My lady," said Stannis <NOBR>softly-or</NOBR> as softly as he could manage, at least. "My lady, will you grant me this dance?" Cersei stared at it, listening to the music playing. <SPAN class="ft1">'Two Hearts That Beat As One', </SPAN>she realized, and recalled Stannis whispering something to young Balon Swann a little earlier. She managed a nod, took Stannis' hand and rose from her seat, walking with him to the center of the floor. <SPAN class="ft1">His hand is trembling</SPAN>, she thought to herself. Looking round she saw all eyes were on them. Stannis turned and bowed to her. And then they began to dance.</P>
<P class="p60 ft2">The King's motions were stiff and awkward, and he stepped on her feet several times. Each time, Cersei heard a titter of laughter ring through the <NOBR>hall-once,</NOBR> she thought she saw her father glaring after such an outburst. She wondered if he still felt he'd chosen wisely in this. When she looked into her husband's face, she saw he was as miserable about this as she was. <SPAN class="ft1">I wonder why he even bothered</SPAN>, she thought. <SPAN class="ft1">He is the King, after all</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2">As the song ended, one of Stannis' arms looped around her legs. With a sudden motion, he had lifted her up off the ground, and cradled her close to his chest. <SPAN class="ft1">Well</SPAN>, thought Cersei, as she dangled there awkwardly, <SPAN class="ft1">he is strong, I'll grant him that</SPAN>. As her hand pressed to his chest, she felt his heart beating like a smith's hammer. "My lords and <NOBR>ladies-honored</NOBR> sers," Stannis stated in a strained and hesitant voice, "I feel it is time for my wife and I to retire for the evening."</P>
<P class="p62 ft2">There were numerous hoots and catcalls to this, as the musicians began to play 'Oh Lay My Sweet Lass Down in the Grass' and one man even shouted out "Show us her tits!" Cersei glared out at the crowd. <SPAN class="ft1">If I ever learn who said that</SPAN>..., she thought to herself, but then shut her eyes. If she ever learnt, she would do nothing, because there would be nothing that she could do. And so she listened to the cries and shouts as her husband carried her away from the chamber, and up the stairs. Eventually, they reached the bedchamber that had been set aside for them, by which time the noise from the revels down below had faded into a dull hum. Stannis deposited her on the bed, and then shut the door.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_7">


<P class="p63 ft2">"My... apologies," said the King quietly. "I... had little desire for a bedding, and... little taste for the feast. I am sorry if I cut short your enjoyment of this night."</P>
<P class="p64 ft2">Cersei took a deep breath. "You cannot cut short something that doesn't exist, Your Grace." She sat up and began to fiddle with her dress. <SPAN class="ft1">The stupid maids tied it all wrong, </SPAN>she thought, biting her lip in frustration. <SPAN class="ft1">It won't come loose</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p65 ft2">Stannis sat down on the bed, and looked at her with his dark blue eyes. "My lady... I... I know I am... not what you expected for a husband. Or what the realm expected for a king. Robert was the one born to rule, and to marry well, the one with a gift for making... people love him." He shook his head. "I never wanted all this. But I will swear to you that I shall do my duty by you."</P>
<P class="p66 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">Why is he telling me this? </SPAN>thought Cersei, as she managed to get her dress untied. "I cannot help but be offended, Your Grace," she said softly, "that you apparently do not want to be married to me."</P>
<P class="p27 ft2">"That is not what I meant," said Stannis, shifting awkwardly. "You are... you are very fair..."</P>
<P class="p53 ft1">If the room were brighter, I wouldn't be surprised to see you blushing like a boy, <SPAN class="ft5">Your Grace</SPAN><SPAN class="ft2">. She couldn't help but think of Jaime, so much bolder than this strange man she was now tied to. </SPAN>If he were here right now, he would not be talking to me like this<SPAN class="ft2">. She smiled at that happy thought, and then turned to the business at hand. "Your Grace," she said, as her dress fell free, "you'll find you're not the only one here who can do their duty. Now come to bed."</SPAN></P>
<P class="p39 ft0">THE <NOBR>FOUL-SMELLING</NOBR> FLOWER</P>
<P class="p67 ft2">There was a resounding crack as Ser Ulwyck Uller of Hellholt and Ser Dezial Dalt of Lemonwood met on the tourney field, their lances breaking on each others' shield. A great cry rose from the commons at this display of martial prowess, while young Viserys clapped his hands and cheered enthusiastically. <SPAN class="ft1">King Viserys</SPAN>, thought Garth Tyrell. <SPAN class="ft1">I must think of him as king</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2">"A fine sport, no?" said Prince Oberyn Martell, glancing at the seneschal.</P>
<P class="p68 ft2">"I am the wrong man to ask," stated Garth quietly. "Never much skill or time for tourneys. Can't even ride a horse these days, I'm afraid." He patted his belly. "I blame my taste for all that fine Dornish food that comes up from the Marches."</P>
<P class="p69 ft2">Martell smiled, and sipped his wine. "Well, at least I can say that you have fine taste in food." The Prince turned to Viserys. "What think you of this, Your Grace?"</P>
<P class="p64 ft2">"It's wonderful!" said the little king, eyes glued to the match. He glanced at his protector Ser Oswell Whent. <NOBR>"Look-look!</NOBR> They're going again!"</P>
<P class="p27 ft2">"Indeed, Your Grace," muttered the Kingsguard member softly.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2">Prince Oberyn smiled at the Ser Oswell. "So, Ser Whent, who do you favor for the victory?"</P>
<P class="p70 ft2">"It's hard to tell," said the Kingsguard. "Ser Dezial has a firmer seat, methinks, but Ser Ulwyck wields a fiercer lance."</P>
<P class="p71 ft2">Oberyn gave a deft nod. "Indeed. Well put, Ser." He took a long swallow of his wine. "I think it will be Uller myself. The young knight of Lemonwood has much potential, but he is still a boy. Ser Ulwyck... is a man."</P>
<P class="p36 ft2">A moment later the Prince's words were proven when Ser Dezial was toppled from his steed, landing with a thud on the ground. The young knight attempted to rise, but then fell back and lay still. As the wardens declared Ser Uller's victory, and his squires carried Ser Dezial to the maesters, the Dornish knight saluted the young king. "For the honor of King Viserys!" declared Uller.</P>
<P class="p72 ft2">Viserys applauded and laughed. "Oh, I like him! I like him! May I put him on the Kingsguard?" Garth couldn't help but think of King Aenys, feasting and feteing as the realm his father conquered fell apart</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_8">


<P class="p73 ft1"><SPAN class="ft2">around him. </SPAN>Unfair, Garth, unfair. He is a boy, and this is all little more than a merry game to him, dead father or no<SPAN class="ft2">.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p74 ft2">"If he continues to fight as he has, Your Grace, then yes." Prince Oberyn smiled. "I must state that he would be an excellent choice. Ulwyck <SPAN class="ft1">burns </SPAN>to avenge your slain father."</P>
<P class="p75 ft4">Garth frowned to himself. They misgave him, all these fiery young followers that had come with the Red <NOBR>Viper-and</NOBR> as opposed to his goodnephew Ser Jon Fossoway, who'd been ranting about it to him the other night, it was not because they were Dornishmen. <SPAN class="ft3">Though I will not deny that adds another wrinkle. How many fights have their been in the Reach's taverns since they came? More than through the entire war so far, that I know for a fact... </SPAN>But <NOBR>no-at</NOBR> heart Garth mistrusted them because it seemed that Prince Oberyn had stripped Dorne of its wildest youngest knights and come to fight a personal mission of vengeance. <SPAN class="ft3">We cannot win this war. He must know this. All we can do is try not to lose too badly, so that our Houses can reach an honorable settlement. But he brings these mad young men </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft3">here-men</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft3"> who think a war can be won with piss and vinegar, and nothing else.</SPAN>..</P>
<P class="p76 ft2">Another cheer came from the crowd, as Ser Garth "Greysteel" Hightower took to the field against Ser Myles Manwoody. <SPAN class="ft1">But there's the problem</SPAN>, thought Garth Tyrell. T<SPAN class="ft1">he Hightowers, the Ashfords, the Caswells, the </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft1">Peakes-half</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft1"> the Houses in Highgarden seem inflicted with the same madness. My nephew lost a fair portion of the Reach's strength outside of Storm's End, and yet people seem to think we'll win</SPAN>. <SPAN class="ft1">Because our cause is just, or some such nonsense. </SPAN>The crowd went wild as Greysteel easily knocked Ser Myles from his horse. <SPAN class="ft1">Dreams of honor and glory. They make men mad</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p15 ft2">"It is a pity your goodsister cannot be here," stated Prince Oberyn.</P>
<P class="p53 ft2">"I fear the Lady Olenna is... <NOBR>ill-disposed</NOBR> at the moment," noted Garth Tyrell. He smiled to himself, as he recalled the Queen of Thorns words on the subject. "Tell them the crack of lances give me headaches," she'd said, something he'd decided not to share. He glanced down to the field, where Lord Commander Hightower continued to watch the match in his gleaming white armor. Garth wondered if he was proud to see his grandnephew's skill. <SPAN class="ft1">Likely, but I doubt he'll show it. Nor show Greysteel any favor that he does not earn. An honorable man. Who will get many people killed, if he has his way</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p15 ft0">THE OLD FALCON</P>
<P class="p77 ft2">"...And Lord Estermont sends his regrets," stated Lord Walter Whent quietly, "but the storm on the Narrow Sea badly damaged the isle's ships. He still is not able to reach us."</P>
<P class="p78 ft2">Jon Arryn rubbed his temples. "It has been months since that storm. And he cannot find a single ship and come to King's Landing?"</P>
<P class="p79 ft2">Whent shrugged, his dark eyes looking troubled. "Not a secure one, I'm afraid." Once again, Jon realized that he missed Hoster Tully. His brother Brynden had gone to Tumbleton to secure it from the Dragon supporters, three weeks ago. Walter Whent had arrived from the Riverlands shortly thereafter. Hoster's goodbrother had buried two sons in what men were starting to call the War of the Dragons and the Stags. While no one doubted Lord Whent's commitment, there were few who'd call him an overly decisive man, as he ran a hand through his greying black hair.</P>
<P class="p80 ft2">"If he were not the King's grandfather," said Kevan, "I'd think he was trying very hard to avoid committing to the Stag's cause..."</P>
<P class="p37 ft2">"He's lost more kin than Robert in this," stated Jon. Privately, he wondered. Lord Baelor Estermont had never been one of the most daring of lords, grand name aside, and if Robert could be believed, Stannis was not the favorite among his grandchildren. The man had children, grandchildren and even <NOBR>great-grandchildren</NOBR> of his own line to consider, and as Robert used to say, his sigil being a turtle was no mistake.</P>
<P class="p81 ft2">"That still does not excuse his tardiness," stated Tywin Lannister, as he strode into the room, Grand Maester Pycelle tottering in after him. "In the time that Estermont has written his latest complaining message, His Grace's pet smuggler has already managed to produce six ships from across the Narrow Sea. With more on</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_9">


<P class="p82 ft2">the way." Tywin confidently took his seat at the table. "If Lord Estermont does not watch himself, he will become the first man to lose a seat at the Small Council before he ever took it."</P>
<P class="p83 ft2">"Third, my lord," said Grand Maester Pycelle. "The first would be Lord Stokeworth in the reign of Daeron II. He was sent to be the new Master of Coins, but he had a brother who fought under the Black Dragon, so Bloodraven persuaded the council to choose someone a little more steady. The second..."</P>
<P class="p84 ft2">"Is irrelevant to our present discussion," said Tywin, glaring at the Grand Maester. He dropped a sealed envelope upon the table. "In here are King Stannis' present appointments to the Small Council." Jon Arryn carefully picked up the envelope. "They are, I believe, Lord Estermont to Master of Ships, Lord Whent to Master of Coins, Lord Arryn to Master of Laws, and myself as Hand to the King."</P>
<P class="p50 ft2">Arryn nodded to himself as he read Stannis' brusque missive. <SPAN class="ft1">When Robert told me how stiff his younger brother was, I always thought he exaggerated</SPAN>. Tywin's Handship had been one of the conditions to his giving the Stags control of King's Landing, along with the marriage of his daughter to Stannis. While the King had consented, the rather curt tone of his letter made it clear he didn't like it. <SPAN class="ft1">Still, who is happy with it aside from the Lannisters? </SPAN>thought Arryn, as he glanced at the scowling form of the Lord of Casterly Rock. <SPAN class="ft1">And perhaps not even them</SPAN>...</P>
<P class="p85 ft2">Ser Kevan regarded his brother with a smile. "How is dear little Cersei?" he asked.</P>
<P class="p86 ft2">"As well as can be expected," replied Tywin curtly. "Now, Ser Kevan, your letter said you have a report from Silverhill?"</P>
<P class="p87 ft1"><SPAN class="ft2">Jon Arryn frowned as Ser Kevan gave a nod. </SPAN>So he has been writing to his brother of our <NOBR>meetings-and</NOBR> the Seven knows what <NOBR>else-this</NOBR> entire time<SPAN class="ft2">... "Ser Stafford has received a raven from Lord Alester Florent. He is Lord Tarly's goodfather, and his brother Ser Axell is serving with him. He believes that he may be able to get Lord Tarly to consider terms. Further, his brother believes he might be able to engineer the surrender of Goldengrove."</SPAN></P>
<P class="p88 ft2">Jon Arryn idly tapped the table. <SPAN class="ft1">A great victory, if they can get it</SPAN>. Though its Lord remained in the custody of the Stags, Goldengrove had remained in the Reach's hands, with Lord Beesbury using it as a base as he hemmed in the Lannister troops to the north. <SPAN class="ft1">This war has not been kind to the glory of Westerland arms, has it? </SPAN>thought Jon. <SPAN class="ft1">Even if this succeeds, what will men say but the men of the Rock only win battles through betrayal?</SPAN></P>
<P class="p89 ft2">"Lord Arryn," said Tywin suddenly. "His Grace will be arriving in King's Landing shortly for his blessing and anointment. He wishes to have a secure city when he enters. As Master of Laws, this will be your duty."</P>
<P class="p90 ft2">"I believe I can manage it, Lord Hand," said Arryn quietly. "I have so far, after all. Why, men even smile when they see warriors of the Vale go past." <SPAN class="ft1">Because they aren't Lannisters</SPAN>, he thought to himself.</P>
